Please add the cURLs of your tests here:

1. I have been using the httprepl tool for testing: 
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/http-repl/?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=window

2. Please use the HttpReplScript.txt file for testing 
   my implementation with that httprepl tool with the following commands:

	2.1. dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.dotnet-httprepl
	2.2. httprepl
	2.3. run <PATH_TO_HttpReplScript.txt>

3. If you want me to add cUrls to this file, please let me know and I will do it.

Thank you!
